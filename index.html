            <p class="centered">This haiku was inspired by the fact that HTML was the first thing I could think of. I already have experience with HTML, so I decided to write the poem about how I think that HTML is a perfect simple backbone for web development.</p>

    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

    <p>
        One of my biggest interests is writing. 
        Since a pretty young age I've been an aspiring author, and I've outlined and started writing lots of projects over the years. 
        I haven't finished quite so many, but I have finished a few.
        As a child I was obsessed with <i>Harry Potter</i>, but getting into Brandon Sanderson's works as a teenager was what really inspired me to write my own stories.
        I think that stories are a fascinating way to explore ideas, and I hope one day to be able to share my own ideas with the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another one of my interests is drumming. 
        Since I got into percussion in middle school it's been a big part of my life, but it wasn't until high school, and marching band, that I really started to get into it.
        I love the process of perfecting a piece of music, and the feeling of playing with a group of people.
        I also love the feeling of performing, and the adrenaline rush that comes with it.
        I now drum in UVU's Green Man Group, and aspire to join a drum corps next summer.
    </p>

    <p>
        A third interest of mine is anime.
        Although as a child I mostly consumed stories through books, recently I've found anime to be a great way to experience stories.
        As I've gotten busier with school and work, anime is a great way to watch a story while also being able to do other things, like drum practice or homework.
        Additionally, it doubles as practice for my Japanese, which is another interest of mine; insights into another culture are always interesting.
        Aside from those factors, I just really enjoy the art style and the way stories are told in anime.
        Any medium will inevitably be hit or miss, but I feel that every anime really commits to its identity, so when it hits it really hits.
